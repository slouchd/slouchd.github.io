  <p>As an engineer, I keep on top of the most recent cybersecurity trends. Ensuring I do the most to keep myself, my customers and the internet secure. It is well known that humans tend to be the weakest link in the chain of security. With that in mind, you may have heard of cat-fishing. But do you know about the larger umbrella of romance scams?</p>
<p>Romance scams are a type of online fraud in which criminals create fake profiles on dating sites, social media platforms, or other online forums. These scammers build relationships with unsuspecting victims, often over a period of months, gaining their trust and affection before ultimately requesting money.</p>
<p>The problem is pervasive and costly, with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reporting that Americans lost over $304 million to romance scams in 2020 alone. What makes these scams particularly insidious is the way that they prey on people&rsquo;s emotions, particularly their loneliness.</p>
<p>It is no secret that loneliness has become a major societal issue, with the COVID-19 pandemic only exacerbating the problem. In this context, it is easy to see why romance scams are so effective. The scammers use a variety of tactics to manipulate their victims, such as showering them with compliments, feigning shared interests and values, and creating elaborate stories to justify their requests for money.</p>
<p>One common tactic is known as &ldquo;love bombing&rdquo;, in which the scammer overwhelms the victim with affection and attention. This can make the victim feel valued and desired, and it creates a sense of intimacy and connection that can be difficult to resist. Over time, the scammer may gradually escalate their requests for money, often with plausible-sounding reasons such as medical emergencies or unexpected expenses.</p>
<p>Another tactic is to create a sense of urgency or fear, such as by threatening to harm the victim or their family if they do not comply with the scammer&rsquo;s demands. This can be particularly effective for victims who are already vulnerable due to their loneliness or other life circumstances.</p>
<p>The rise of social media and online dating has made it easier than ever for scammers to find and target their victims. While law enforcement agencies are working to crack down on these scams, prevention is often the best defense. It is important to be aware of the warning signs of romance scams, such as requests for money, inconsistencies in the scammer&rsquo;s story, and reluctance to meet in person or engage in video chats.</p>
<p>If you suspect that you or someone you know may be the victim of a romance scam, it is important to report it to the appropriate authorities. The FTC offers a range of resources for reporting and recovering from these scams, and local law enforcement agencies may also be able to assist.</p>
<p>In short, romance scams are a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for their victims. By understanding the tactics used by scammers and being vigilant for the warning signs, we can help to protect ourselves and our communities from these insidious frauds.</p>
